Project specifications:

"Bitcoin Price Index
Bitcoin is a form of digitial currency, otherwise known as cryptocurrency. Rather than rely on a central authority like a bank, Bitcoin instead relies on a distributed network, otherwise known as a blockchain, to record transactions.

Because there’s demand for Bitcoin (i.e., users want it), users are willing to buy it, as by exchanging one currency (e.g., USD) for Bitcoin.

In a file called bitcoin.py, implement a program that:

Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins, , that they would like to buy. If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float. Be sure to catch any exceptions, as with code like:
import requests

try:
    ...
except requests.RequestException:
    ...
Outputs the current cost of  Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.

How to Test
Here’s how to test your code manually:

Run your program with python bitcoin.py. Your program should use sys.exit to exit with an error message:
Missing command-line argument   
Run your program with python bitcoin.py cat. Your program should use sys.exit to exit with an error message:
Command-line argument is not a number
Run your program with python bitcoin.py 1. Your program should output the price of a single Bitcoin to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.
Run your program with python bitcoin.py 2. Your program should output the price of two Bitcoin to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.
Run your program with python bitcoin.py 2.5. Your program should output the price of 2.5 Bitcoin to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.
